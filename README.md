# FinFlow — Full-Stack Personal Finance Manager

FinFlow is a robust, high-performance personal finance management system designed for modern personal accounting. It allows users to track incomes and expenses, manage flexible categories, and analyze financial health with real-time multi-currency conversion and smart data processing.

> **Production Status**: The project has successfully passed the staging phase and is fully deployed in a secure production environment. Active support, monitoring, and regular architectural improvements are performed 24/7.

## Live Production

The application is fully operational and accessible globally via secure HTTPS protocol:

## Deployment & DevOps Architecture

The production environment is built with fault-tolerance, isolation, and industry-standard security practices in mind:

* **Web Server & Reverse Proxy**: `Nginx` handles high-performance static file serving for the React frontend (`/dist` package compiled via `pnpm`) and acts as a reverse proxy for the backend, managing transparent route rewrites (stripping `/api/` prefixes) and custom header injection (`X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`).
* **Containerization & Isolation**: The entire backend ecosystem (FastAPI ASGI application, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache) is containerized via `Docker Compose`. Container ports are strictly isolated within an internal virtual bridge network, leaving no exposed database ports to the host network.
* **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Automated cryptographic certificates provided by `Let's Encrypt` (`Certbot`) with enforced global HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
* **Server Hardening & Security**: Host-level access is restricted strictly to authorized SSH keys with password authentication completely disabled. The server utilizes automated brute-force protection, strict network-level firewalls, and active log parsing to mitigate remote access risks.

## Awards & Recognition

FinFlow secured **1st Place** at a regional college web development and programming competition (May 2026) and has received official accreditation from the **Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine**. The project was highly evaluated by the expert jury for its complex asynchronous backend architecture, Redis caching integration, and fault-tolerant external API parsing.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based system with Access & Refresh token rotation, Argon2 password hashing, and built-in rate limiting (SlowAPI).
- **Two-Step Email Verification**: Registration requires email confirmation via a 6-digit one-time code (valid for 10 minutes), delivered through the Resend API. Disposable and temporary email addresses are blocked at the schema level.
- **Real-time Multi-currency**: Automatic exchange rate synchronization (via NBU API) with Redis caching. View your balance in **USD, EUR, UAH, PLN (Zloty), RUB, or CZK**.
- **Financial Analytics**:
    - Summary dashboards for Balance, Income, and Expenses.
    - Average daily spending and income calculation for specific periods.
    - Real-time balance conversion based on live market rates.
- **Advanced Transaction Management**:
    - **Cursor-based Pagination**: Optimized infinite scrolling for smooth browsing of large transaction histories.
    - **Dynamic Filtering**: Comprehensive data filtering by date range, category, or type.
    - **Smart Date Parsing**: Intelligent input processor (English/Russian support).
- **Data Portability**: Full support for Importing and Exporting financial history via JSON files (with strict backend payload size validation).
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive dashboard with native Dark Mode support.

## Authentication Flow

Registration is a two-step process designed to ensure account validity:

1. **Step 1 — Sign Up**: The user submits a username, email, and password. The backend validates the input (password: 12–64 characters, no disposable email domains) and sends a 6-digit verification code to the provided email via Resend.
2. **Step 2 — Email Verification**: The user enters the code received in the email. Upon successful verification, the account is created and the user is automatically signed in via HttpOnly cookie-based tokens.

Password reset is also fully supported — a time-limited reset link (valid 10 minutes) is sent to the user's email and processed on a dedicated `/reset-password` page.

## Testing

The system is covered by a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and security.
```bash
pytest
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

FinFlow uses **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployment on every push to the `main` branch (or via manual trigger through `workflow_dispatch`). The pipeline consists of two sequential jobs:

1. **`test`** — spins up a clean environment on `ubuntu-latest`:
   - Checks out the repository.
   - Reconstructs the `.env` file from a GitHub Secret (`ENV_FILE`), keeping sensitive configuration out of the codebase.
   - Starts an isolated test database via `docker-compose.test.yml`.
   - Sets up Python 3.12 and installs backend dependencies.
   - Runs the full `pytest` suite. Deployment is blocked if any test fails.

2. **`deploy`** — runs only after `test` succeeds (`needs: test`):
   - Connects to the production VPS over SSH (`appleboy/ssh-action`), using host, username, and private key stored as encrypted GitHub Secrets (`VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_SSH_KEY`).
   - Pulls the latest changes on the server (`git pull`).
   - Rebuilds and restarts backend containers via `docker compose up -d --build`.
   - Rebuilds the frontend production bundle (`pnpm run build`) inside the `frontend/` directory.

## Security & Performance

* **Brute-force protection**: Strict rate limiting implemented on sensitive endpoints.
* **Email Verification**: All new accounts require confirmation via a one-time 6-digit code. Disposable email domains are blocked via `disposable-email-domains`.
* **Data Integrity**: Powered by **Pydantic v2**, ensuring strict validation at the schema level.
* **Asynchronous Architecture**: Fully non-blocking I/O operations for high concurrency.
* **Secure Data Storage**: Professional standards using HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookie attributes.
